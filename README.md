Main repository of **Back to the Future: Efficient, Time-Consistent Solutions in Reach-Avoid Games** accepted to [ICRA 2022](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.07673.pdf)

Code is tested on M1 Mac and Ubuntu 20.04 using Conda environment (4.10.3). Check ```requirements.txt``` for required packages.

The following runs are fully supported:
* One player case, single goal with multiple obstacles in free space (pinch-point and time consistent).
* Three players case, t-intersection environment (pinch-point and time consistent).
* Two players case, t-intersection environment (pinch-point and time consistent, cooperative and adversarial).

# How to run
Run ```run.py``` directly with flags to change the env configs
```
python3 run.py [flags]
```
Example:
```
python3 run.py --no_players 1 --env_type goal_with_obs --init_states 6.0 0.0 1.563 0.0 8.0
```
Or run our samples listed in *./example*:
```
python3 example/<name of example>
```
For example:
```
python3 example/one_player_time_consistent.py
```

Evaluate GIF file can be created using ```evaluate.py```
```
python3 evaluate.py --loadpath result/experiment_2022-02-20-11_58_33/ --evaluate rollout
```
You can specify which iteration you want to create GIF image by adding in ```--iteration <iteration>``` to the command.

```evaluate.py``` supports five different runs:
* Evaluate the training process (for all cases), ```--evaluate train```
* Evaluate the rollout (for all cases), ```--evaluate rollout```
* Evaluate the concave hull of all the trajectories created during the training process (for two and three-player case) ```--evaluate spectrum```
* Evaluate the train then do rollout on the chosen terminal iteration (for all cases), ```--evaluate train_then_rollout```
* Evaluate a single trajectory (for all cases) ```--evaluate trajectory```

## Run evaluate for train process
When run evaluate for train process, all images generated throughout the run will be merged to a GIF file showing the training process. The following GIF is a sample output from this process. The flag ```--loadpath``` has to be an experiment directory with ```figures``` folder.
```
# Time consistent sample run
python3 evaluate.py --loadpath result/experiment_2022-02-28-11_42_44 --evaluate train

# Pinch-point sample run
python3 evaluate.py --loadpath result/experiment_2022-02-28-11_46_04 --evaluate train
```
Output:

<p float="left" style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="result/experiment_2022-02-28-11_42_44/figures/evaluate_training.gif" width="250">
    <img src="result/experiment_2022-02-28-11_46_04/figures/evaluate_training.gif" width="250">
</p>

**Note**: This works for all run cases, provided that all figures of training process is stored in folder structure ```result/<experiment>/figures/```.

## Run evalute rollout of chosen iteration
When you want to deploy your trajectory, you can use ```--evaluate rollout```. It will get the trajectory of the chosen iteration via ```--iteration <number>``` or the last iteration if flag is not passed, and generate a GIF showing the deployment of players following the chosen trajectories:

```
# Time consistent sample run
python3 evaluate.py --loadpath result/experiment_2022-02-28-11_42_44 --evaluate rollout

# Pinch-point sample run
python3 evaluate.py --loadpath result/experiment_2022-02-28-11_46_04 --evaluate rollout
```

Output:

<p float="left" style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="result/experiment_2022-02-28-11_42_44/evaluate/evaluate_rollout.gif" width="250">
    <img src="result/experiment_2022-02-28-11_46_04/evaluate/evaluate_rollout.gif" width="250">
</p>

```
# Three-player case sample run
python3 evaluate.py --loadpath result/experiment_2022-02-21-20_51_25 --evaluate rollout
```
Output:

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="./result/experiment_2022-02-21-20_51_25/evaluate/evaluate_rollout.gif" alt="drawing" width="300"/>

## Run evaluate the range of trajectories while training
A concave hull will be created to bound all the generated trajectories throughout training to give you a visualization of the set of trajectories. Pass ```--evaluate spectrum``` to the command to run this function
```
python3 evaluate.py --loadpath result/experiment_2022-02-21-21_46_25 --evaluate spectrum --iteration 84
```
You can also specify which iteration to plot on top of the concave hull by passing ```--iteration <number>```. If no iteration flag is passed, last iteration will be used.
Output:

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="./result/experiment_2022-02-21-21_46_25/evaluate/spectrum.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

**Note**: This only works for two-player and three-player case as of now.

## Run evaluate on training then execute rollout on the chosen trajectory
A combination of running training then once a trajectory is chosen, via flag```--iteration``` or the max iteration will be used if flag is ```None```, do rollout.
```
python3 evaluate.py --loadpath result/experiment_2022-02-21-21_46_25 --evaluate train_then_rollout --iteration 84 --with_trajectory
```

Output
<p float="left" style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="./result/experiment_2022-02-21-21_46_25/evaluate/evaluate_training_then_rollout.gif
" width="300">
</p>

## Run evaluate for a single trajectory
Evaluate a single chosen trajectory on iteration defined by either the max iteration in log file or iteration given by ```--iteration```.

You can choose where to plot the player(s) by using flag ```--interpolation``` with list of all indices.

```
python3 evaluate.py --loadpath result/experiment_2022-02-19-20_48_36 --evaluate trajectory --interpolation 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40
```

Output:
<p float="left" style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="./result/experiment_2022-02-19-20_48_36/evaluate/trajectory_3.png" width="300">
</p>

# Batch run
There is a ```run_batch.py``` file to help automatically generate randomized initialization data for multiple runs for one-player case. Change the initialization range in the script before running to match your targeted test cases. You can either choose to run only **time_consistent**, **time_inconsistent** or **both**. If **both** is chosen, the test cases across time consistetn and inconsistent will be the same. Each experiment in the batch will have its own log file and figures, there will also be a common batch log to record all commands used to run the experiments in the batch.
**Note**: If you do not want to either have logs or plots, or methods of running for the batch run, change information in the **base_flag** in the script.
```
base_flag = "   python3 run.py                      \
                --no_players 1                      \
                --env_type goal_with_obs            \
                --eps_control 0.1 --eps_state 0.1   \
                --linesearch                        \
                --alpha_scaling trust_region        \
                --batch_run                         \
                --plot                              \
                --log                               \
                --hallucinated                      \
            "
```

Once finish running, you can analyze the data in the batch by either running ```analyze.ipynb```. Each batch can be imported as a ```Batch``` object with certain functions. You can also quickly check on the convergence rate of the batch run and see the resulting plots by running ```evaluate_batch.py```.
```
python3 evaluate_batch.py --loadpath result/batch-2022-02-23/ --exp_suffix exp_time_consistent
```

# Adversarial
Adversarial-Cooperative run is currently constructed only for two vehicles, and vehicle 2 is the one that is chosen to be temporarily adversarial.

For this run, determine the time step that vehicle 2 switches from being adversarial to cooperative: ```--t_react```.

A sample run is shown below, with **red** meaning vehicle 2 is in the adversarial phase and **yellow** meaning vehicle 2 is in cooperative phase:
